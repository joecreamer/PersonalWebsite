        <p class="card-panel">
            Drake Maye deserves the NFL MVP award because he's done what no sophomore has done before at this level. While other MVP candidates have talented rosters around them, Maye has carried the Patriots with very limited weapons. He's proven he can compete with veteran quarterbacks who have years of experience. His stats compare well to the best in the league, and he's doing it in his second year in the NFL.

        <p class="card-panel">
            The traditional argument against second years winning MVP doesn't apply to Maye. He's not just having a good second year season, he's having one of the best quarterback seasons in the entire league. He leads multiple statistical categories and has carried his team to wins they had no business getting. The Patriots were predicted to barely make the playoffs (if that), but Maye has made them competitive every single week with a 9-2 reccord currently.

        <p class="card-panel">
            Maye passes the eye test to viewers, analysts and even his opponents. When you watch him play, you see a quarterback who belongs in MVP conversations. His arm talent, decision-making and scrambling show he's absolutely the best young QB. He's brought excitement back to New England and proven that young players can absolutely be the most valuable player in the league. Drake Maye is rewriting the rules of what a 23 year old can accomplish.
